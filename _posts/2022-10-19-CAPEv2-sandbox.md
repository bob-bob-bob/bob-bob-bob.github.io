Once upon a time, there was Cuckoo Sandbox. 

It's old news. Hasn't been updated for a couple of years, all the articles about how to set it up are old and say to run it on Ubuntu 18 .. but 22.04 is out now.

Yes I did get it set up on Ubuntu 20.04 and it runs fine and works as it should - but what a mission! See the previous post about it.

Enter CAPE Sandbox, now up to v2.2.
It is recommended to run CAPE on Ubuntu 22.04 and is based on python3 - unlike Cuckoo which is still based on python2.7!

### Data to come
