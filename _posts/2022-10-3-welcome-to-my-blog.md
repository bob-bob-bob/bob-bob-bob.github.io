title: Welcome to my blog!

This blog is a personal project for me to share my insights and learnings into malware. I am very much a beginner RE learner so this site is just to write down my notes and ramblings.

No promises on how often I will update this page - just whenever I have the time or are working on something interesting.

If you happen to learn something with me, great!

Enjoy!
